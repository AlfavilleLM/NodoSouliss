# NodoSouliss

NodoSouliss is a program aid for creating sketches Souliss.
It is designed for those who begin to use the Souliss libraries for SmartHome and Internet of Things.

Data about the hardware, the node type and interface, and the configuration of each of the slots
is performed in a graphic IDE and once the desired configuration is complete, a <.ino> type file
is generated with the source code sketch, which after adding the desired customization, if any,
can be compiled in the Arduino IDE.

NodoSouliss is distributed as a <.rar> file that contains all the options and requires no installation.
You only need to unpack it into the desired folder and can be used.
